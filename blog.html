      <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">My Journey Back To Web Development</h2>
          <em><strong>27 December 2020</strong></em>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        I graduated from university about a decade ago. In my second year I took a course in
        electronic commerce and web development. I found web development to be interesting and
        wanted to pursue it futher. But I was hindered by the fact that I had no personal computer and was forced to use lab computers which
        had only proprietary software installed and time usage restrictions.
        That pretty much dissuaded me from pursuing web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following years I concentrated on game development and more recently, machine learning.
        These two areas were a natural fit for me since mathematics plays a central part and I have always had a passion for mathematics.
        There’s something beautiful and fascinating  I find about mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now back to talking about open source software. In 2014 I enrolled for an honours degree in information technology.
        Although I did not complete my honours, it was my first practical experience using open source software.
        I thoroughly enjoyed the course about Linux System Administraton.
        From then onwards I’ve always made sure to use free sofware whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then open souce software has been widely adapted and in some cases it is as good
        or even better than proprietary softwarwe. The open source frameworks I’m currently working with
         have enabled me to undertake personal projects without having to worry too much about costs.
         Google’s Tensorflow framework for numerical computations and machine learning; Tensforflow.js framework
         for training and deploying machine learning in the browser and the Phaser 3 game engine for creating HTML 5 games.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the framework that really reignited my love for web development is React.js.
        Although I’m fairly a beginner in using React, I find creating user interfaces with it to be enjoyable and intuitive.
        Thanks to the work of the open source community I’m no longer afraid to take risks when thinking about doing a personal project.
