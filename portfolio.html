        <h1>Petal To Metal Competition</h1>
          <em><strong>07 December 2020 - January 2021</strong></em>
          <p>The project is an on going Kaggle competition in which the the aim
             is to build a machine learning
            model that classifies flowers into 104 types of classes.Each entrant's
            progress is displayed as a score on a leaderboard. In order to move
             up the leaderboard the model must constantly be improved to make
             better classifications.
          </p>
          <p>I am constantly tweaking the model in order to imporve its accuracy
             and move up the leaderboard. More details about the competition are

        <em><strong>01 November 2020 - 30 November 2020</strong></em>
        <p> The goal of the project is to predict a high school student's final Mathematics'
          grade or mark based on a number of factors.Factors considered were length
          of studytime, home internet access, parents' educational qualificatons etc.
          Several models were trained on the students' dataset; which consisted of
          only 300 students. Utlimatley the Lasso Regression model was selected as
          it performed the best when making predictions on the test data.
        </p>
        <p>Python programming language and he Scikit-Learn library were to train
          the
          model and making predictions. The source code of the project as well
          as the
          dataset is available on

            This is an educational game that combines interger arithmetic with the
            classic game of snakes and ladders. After rolling two dices the
            player can move foward, stay in the same place or move backward.
            As usual the player must watch out for the snakes. The final tile
            must be reached before the timer reaches zero.
